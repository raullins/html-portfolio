<h2>My top 3 movies so far</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Mad-Max: Fury road</h3>
<p>Action packed beginning to end, never gets boring. I've alredy watched more than 30 times just this month.</p>

<h3>Redline</h3>
<p>Beautifully animated movie. Lots of action, cars and very charismatic characters.</p>

<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>Love the book series, and Villeneuve did a great job at adapting it to the big screens.</p>
